MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast 🚀.

Try it

❤️ Powerful: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in JSX-based projects.

💻 Everything is a component: Import JSX components and render them directly in your MDX document.

🔧 Customizable: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown element.

📚 Markdown-based: The simplicity and elegance of Markdown remains, you interleave JSX only when you want to.

🔥 Blazingly blazing fast: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage.

This goes wrong still

<div style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "tomato" }}>
	<h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>
